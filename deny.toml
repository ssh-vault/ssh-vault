    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack on RSA
    # This is a known timing side-channel vulnerability in RSA decryption.
    # We acknowledge this risk. The vulnerability requires:
    # 1. Network-observable timing attacks
    # 2. Many decryption attempts to recover the key
    # For ssh-vault's use case (local decryption, single attempt), the risk is acceptable.
    # We're tracking upstream fix: https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/issues/19
